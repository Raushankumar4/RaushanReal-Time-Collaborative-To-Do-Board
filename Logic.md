# 🧠 Smart Assign & Conflict Handling – Logic Explanation

## ✅ How I implemented Smart Assign

The goal of Smart Assign is to automatically assign a task to the person who is the **least busy** — that is, the user with the **fewest current active tasks**.

### Here’s how I thought about it:

- When someone clicks **Smart Assign**, I first check all users in the system.
- For each user, I calculate how many tasks they are working on. I count only those tasks that are still **active** (either in **"Todo"** or **"In Progress"**).
- Once I know how many tasks each user has, I look for the one with the **smallest number** — meaning the person with the lightest workload.
- Then, I assign the task to that user.

This logic ensures that work is distributed fairly — no one gets overloaded, and people with fewer tasks get new tasks first.

✅ It even works perfectly if a user has **zero tasks** — they’ll be picked first.

## 🛡️ How my Conflict Handling works

In a real-time app, multiple users may work on the same task at the same time. So I made sure my app handles that safely using **Socket.IO**.

### Example situation:

- Two users open the same task.
- User A changes the title and clicks "Save".
- User B changes the description and also clicks "Save" a few seconds later.

### Here’s what happens:

1. User A’s update goes to the backend first.
2. The task is updated in the database.
3. A `task:updated` event is emitted via Socket.IO.
4. Every user’s UI (including User B’s) receives the updated task and re-renders it in real-time.

So by the time User B submits their changes, they already see the latest data, which helps avoid overwriting any recent updates.

This keeps everything synchronized and prevents users from accidentally editing stale data.

## ✅ Summary:

- **Smart Assign** = Fairly distributes tasks by picking the user with the fewest current active tasks.
- **Conflict Handling** = Uses real-time socket updates so all users instantly see the latest version of each task — preventing edit conflicts.
